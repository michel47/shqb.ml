title: Self Health Quantification *block*Ring™ 
---

### Introduction

The [blockchain][1] is an incorruptible digital ledger that can be used to
record anything. It permits digital information to be distributed without
a centralized server. Secure data-blocks are bound by cryptographic
principles (chain). Cryptocurrency is the first blockchain use; however,
its potential extends far beyond. Block chain technology may offer
a reliable, consistent solution to catalogue and share research and
personal health data.


### Self-health quantification *block*Ring™ ([SHQB][2]) is providing you 

#### Personal health record

The [SHQB][2] provides a consistent, private, reliable location for your data
you can access easily using a variety of applications. Information will
never be too old or impossible to access and it stays with you for life.

You can approve medical provider access to your information, which is
easily downloadable and augmented by any practitioner.

Allows you to collect data on symptoms and responses to medications,
nutritional therapies, and other lifestyle modifications. Graphs provide
easy to read information on trends and changes over time; including
a timeline chart that shows how events in your life correspond with
changes in your health.

Recording what you think is significant empowers you to view a visual
representation of your health data. With this information, you may
choose to make personal changes to benefit your health resilience. You
also empower your health care practitioners to help you through access
to pre-analyzed historical health data.

#### Research data provision

Consistency in data collection and categorization allows you to
participate in retrospective and prospective research programs.
Crypto-tokenization can be used for incentivization.

### Technical Details 

Our [blockRing™][3] technology as opposed to more classic blockchain approach
doesn't require a large network to be operational,
In fact a minimum of two nodes are required for the system to work.

Moreover it requires no centralized server and therefore can scale globally
establishing a global [EHR-system][4] available for both the researchers
and the medical staff available anywhere beyond borders,
while suppressing the risk of data breaches.

##### De-identification : Not anonymous yet private 

User privacy is protected at all time with the use of asymmetric cryptography
([one-time-identity][5] tokenization).
Only the owner of the data has the keys to grant access
to the data to certified personal and registered organizations.

###### This technology gives the control of personal data back to the user

### Conclusion

The [SHQB][2] integrates fundamental blockchain concepts with decentralization,
asymmetric cryptography and [de-identification][6] to create an [easy to understand][7]
technology.

The [SHQB][2] holds the potential to improve access to and
quality of research data collection, as well as, medical, nutrition and
lifestyle care,

It empowers patients, researchers, and providers to work together toward
the development of individualized care, with a secure permanent data
record available across organizations and borders while mitigating the
risk of breaches.
