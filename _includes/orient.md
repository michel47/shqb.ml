## Self Quantification *block*Chain 

With the abundance of self quantification data,
*block*chain can be a very nice platform
for a citizen participatory health research
leading to personal health advances.

### We want to make self-quantification so easy that everyone will do it.

This is what motivates us to develop [SHQB](SHQB.htm)

<br>

Required "infrastructure" to enable easy quantification and sharing of the data.

* easy capture
* no friction sign-up
* available anytime
* private and secure
