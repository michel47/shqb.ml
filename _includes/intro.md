## Self Quantification *block*Chain 

With the abundance of self quantification data,
*block*chain can be a very nice platform
for a citizen participatory health research
leading to personal health advances.

### We want to make self-quantification so easy that everyone will do it.

This is what motivates us to develop [SHQB](SHQB.htm).

SHQB is a permissionned *block*chain, it run on top of [IPFS]
and using the SHAKE-224 sponge function for securing the records,
and the IDENT20 identity hash for the mutables. 


<br>

Our objective for the blockchain is facilitating the capture and sharing of personal data,
such that anyone can maintain her own *personal*-health-record [PHR]

* easy capture
* no friction sign-up
* available anytime
* private and secure

[IPFS]: {{site.search}}=IPFS+and+%22blockRing™%22
[PHR]: {{site.search}}=Personal+Health+Record+on+the+%22blockRing™%22
