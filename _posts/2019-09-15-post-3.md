Finance, Insurance, Healthcare, all rely on leaky proof in their operations,
leading to the bigger horror stories, from perso info leaked, CCard number, 


Self sovereign Identity requires a mean of proving one identity or [nym],
without giving away critical information which can be malinianly reuse by corrupted individuals

a proof can be 
- an age range proof
- a degree possession proof, (degree signed by University)
- a proof of solvency (balance > X) (certified by financial institution)
- a statement of ID attribute certified by institution or gov)
- a solution to an equation proof f(x) = 0
- a proof of membership
- a proof of trust


Proofs property:

 * completeness (if both honest can't convince it is false)
 * soundness (if false can't convince it is true)
 * zero-knowledge


## Zero Knowledge Proof

Example : interactive ZK Proof Riddles

* Where is Waldo ?
* Easter Egg Hunt (single egg left)
* Leaves on a tree superpower
* Alibaba cave with special key
* Sudoku Solution

* Swapping 2 different objects (color balls)
* key to door lock (tunnel)
* range proof of salary

## Homomorphism (arithmetically conservative)

* F(x+y) = F(x) + F(y) 

## commitement (bet in future)

 msg -[commit]-> H(msg) -[open]-> msg (msg revealed)


homomorphic commitment + range
inner product proofs

## This is where zero-knowledge proof are powerful

Cryptography give us a way to secure point-to-point communication,

Pseudo anonymous blockchain try to solve the "point-to-many" security
permission blockchain are simply using the point-to-point
 i.e. the security problem disappear when intermediary are removed
