We believe in the wisdom gained with sharing our health data,
still remaining secure and preserving everyone privacy.

*block*chain can be a very nice way to deploy the infrastructure
require for a global health research to improve personal health.

And selfquantification data is at the fuel for advancement.

### Self Quantification *block*Chain 

read our [abstract](home.htm) <abstract.txt>

## Why *block*chain ?

* allow health continuity, access anytime, anywhere

* blockchain: open data, borders agnostic
* blockchain: chained links provide security / integrity
* blockchain: distributed translated to easy accessibility
* blockchain: decentralized : resilience
* blockchain: tracability
* blockchain: discoverable (no wall guarded garden)

* blockchain: integrative uniform access, AI enabled
* blockchain: easy to deploy
* blockchain: resistance to manipulation

* have a plurality of side benefits
  (permanent,log trail,versionning,privacy,concensus,discoverable) 

* *block*Chain is omnipresent is modern system ...

### Allow for:

* apps consumer not accessible for research
* self reporting, manual data capture, (myfood24)
* digital imaging
* reduce friction: sensors, wearable
* ML, validation,
* vision based : volume, 2 shots + 3D reconstitution
