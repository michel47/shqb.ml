# {{page.title}} 

This is a simple index markup file I use for this webpage
is has a few links to :

-  a [README](README.html) file,
-  a [frama](frama.htm) page and
-  a [landing](landing.htm) one.
-  a [newsletter](newsletter.htm),
-  a few [links](links.html),
-  the other [home.htm](home.htm) file.
