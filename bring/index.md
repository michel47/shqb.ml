#### What is a blockRing ?

 * It is a blockChain (an ecofriendly one : no mining)

   1. linked "blocks" (data record)
   2. distribution network
   3. rule and means for publishing update (at global scale)

 * the last block (*HEAD*) is linked to placeholder block (*NEXT*) using "signed" link.
  the next block is mutable this means that its contant can be updated by its owner
  and this block is linked back to the first block (*GENESIS*) closing the loop.

Conventional blockchain are linear chains, there are open ended, making it hard for a user to verify
which version is accurate, when a chain is "closed" with a signed lock*pad*, only the last owner can
add block to the chain.

You may wonder why *block*Chain, as compared to conventional database ?

## Why *block*chain ?

* allow health continuity, access anytime, anywhere

* blockchain: open data, borders agnostic
* blockchain: linked data == knowledge sharing, beyond-information, data intelligence
* blockchain: chained links provide security / integrity
* blockchain: distributed translated to easy accessibility
* blockchain: decentralized : resilience
* blockchain: tracability (travelling back the foodchain)
* blockchain: discoverable (no wall guarded garden)

* blockchain: integrative uniform access, AI enabled for ML
* blockchain: easy to deploy
* blockchain: resistance to manipulation

* have a plurality of side benefits
  (permanent, log trail, versionning, privacy, concensus, discoverable)

* *block*Chain is omnipresent is modern system ...

### Allow for:

* consumer apps to be accessible for research
* self reporting, easy capture
* reducing friction: connected sensors, wearable etc.
