## Why *block*chain ?

* allow health continuity, access anytime, anywhere

* blockchain: open data, borders agnostic
* blockchain: linked data == knowledge sharing, beyond-information, data intelligence
* blockchain: chained links provide security / integrity
* blockchain: distributed translated to easy accessibility
* blockchain: decentralized : resilience
* blockchain: tracability (travelling back the foodchain)
* blockchain: discoverable (no wall guarded garden)

* blockchain: integrative uniform access, AI enabled for ML
* blockchain: easy to deploy
* blockchain: resistance to manipulation

* have a plurality of side benefits
  (permanent,log trail,versionning,privacy,concensus,discoverable)

* *block*Chain is omnipresent is modern system ...

### Allow for:

* to turn consumer apps accessible for research
* self reporting, easy capture
* reduce friction: connected sensors, wearable
